**Description:** This figure presents the ratio of successful employment outcomes for transition-age youth clients in comparison to all other clients within a specific occupation type.The results are presented by geographic location and can be filtered by year and occupation type. By calculating ratio in this way, we are able to control for the total number of clients that are being served by an agency.

Ratio = Number of transition-age clients closed successfully in a particular ocupation/ Number of all other clients closed successfully in a particular occupation.

For example, in 2012 the ratio for Iowa was 2.2 for 'Construction and Extraction Related Occupations', which means that for every 100 non-transition clients that were successfully closed in 'Construction and Extraction Related Occupations' there were 220 transition-age youth clients placed in the same occupation type. 

**Population:** Transition-age youth

**Data Source:** RSA-911
