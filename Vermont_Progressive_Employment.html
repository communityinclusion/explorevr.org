title: Vermont Progressive Employment
---

<p><a href="http://vocrehab.vermont.gov">Vermont DVR</a> will work with the ICI to implement a learning collaborative for rolling out the Progressive Employment (PE) Model in state VR agencies.  The study will document the implementation of this model at several learning collaborative sites and any potential impacts that the adoption of the model may have on employment outcomes.  The study will also capture VR consumers and employers’ experiences and perceptions of the PE model.</p>
<p>The PE model centers on a dual-customer approach that reduces employer risk in providing work opportunities for jobseekers on the path to competitive employment. It gives VR employment specialists a range of options to offer to employers including: On the Job Training, Temp to Hire, Work Experience with stipends, and Company Tours and Job Shadows. To learn more about PE, check out the resources below.</p>
<p>The learning collaborative approach will engage peer agencies, maximize efficiency of technical assistance processes, improve fidelity of implementation, and create an infrastructure for problem solving and solutions.
