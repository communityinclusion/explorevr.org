Research and Technical Assistance Center (RTAC) identifies, tests, and disseminates vocational rehabilitation (VR) program management practices that improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. RTAC generates new knowledge by identifying effective practices in the areas of Quality Assurance (QA), Human Resources (HR), and Strategic Planning (SP) and through a nine states VR Management Learning Collaborative.  VR agencies can benefit from RTAC by accessing exemplars, tools, and guidance on how to implement the model within their unique contexts.
