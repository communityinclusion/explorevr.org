      The ACCES workforce development and business relations team includes a statewide coordinator, who develops relationships with businesses that have a statewide presence; five regional coordinators, who develop relationships with regional companies based on labor market demand; and 15 local workforce development and business relations staff, who develop local business relations and work with the regional and statewide coordinators to implement activities on a broader scale. 
</p>
<p>
The whole team works directly with businesses to understand their employment needs and to find candidates who are appropriate matches. Team members also work closely with job seekers, discovering their skills and placing them in on-the-job trainings (OJTs) and work tryouts. ACCES reimburses 100% of an employeeâ€™s wages for up to 480 hours for OJTs and work tryouts.</p>
<p>
The ACCES team also provides job coaches, who work with the business and the employee to understand the needs of both. Team members offer assistance on accommodations, tax credits, accessibility, and diversity training. They provide publications about hiring people with disabilities, and celebrate National Disability Awareness month by giving awards to businesses who are committed to hiring people with disabilities in their communities.</p>
<p>
The ACCES workforce development and business relations team is aligned with the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation national employment team.</p>
