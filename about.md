## ExploreVR

### Background

ExploreVR is a web application providing state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies easy and convenient access to a range of VR and related data for planning, evaluation, and decision-making. Overall, this data-sharing effort seeks to increase knowledge about the public VR program and its role within the larger employment and disability service system within and across states and territories.

### Uses of ExploreVR

VR counselors can use the data portal to get information about other public employment services in their state.  
VR staff can use ExploreVR to compare their agency to other similarly structured VR agencies with respect to employment outcomes, agency partnerships, state demographics and other data points. Ultimately, they can use these results for their planning efforts.

### VR-RRTC

ExploreVR is part of the Vocational Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (VR-RRTC) at the Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston ([www.communityinclusion.org][1]). The VR-RRTC is a national center that builds the capacity of the public VR program to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. The VR-RRTC is funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the US Department of Education. Visit the VR-RRTC website ([www.vr-rrtc.org][2]) for more information about the center’s policy research, training, and technical assistance efforts.

###Accessibility Statement  

ExploreVR strives to make all of its web products accessible and usable to all people, regardless of ability or disability. The overall goal is for our web products to be accessible and usable to anyone connecting in any way. This means that they work for people using screen readers, text-only browsers, keyboards only (no mouse), wireless (phone, PDA), slow connections (dial-up), etc.  

ExploreVR makes every effort to achieve compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 ([http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)). This helps to ensure that our content is accessible to all users. The accessibility guidelines include using well-formed and highly organized content, providing alternatives to visual elements, captioning video/audio, and being aware of color/contrast, mobility, and cognitive issues. For the application elements, we will use the Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) standard, which provides guidelines for the more interactive and application-like web products. This ensures that our content is both backwards- and future-compatible, and that standard-based technologies (browsers) can access our documents. All browsers can access our site and get an accessible version of all our content.


### The Open Data Initiative

ExploreVR is committed to the Open Data initiative that is being embraced by the U.S. government and around the nation. Our goal is to allow decision-makers, researchers and web builders access to all of the VR data that we collect. To that end, we release the data in its most raw form, as well as build useful applications to view the data. Because we take part in Open Data it is our hope that others will build and expand off of the work that we put forth.
