<h2>RTAC INNOVATION WEBINAR SERIES</h2>

<p><strong>Join Us for the RTAC Innovation Webinar Series!</strong></p>

<p>Please join the ICI for our upcoming webinar series, Innovation in VR Program Management. These webinars are part of an ongoing series where members of the NIDRR-funded RTAC on Vocational Rehabilitation Program Management present the projects they’ve implemented and the lessons they’ve learned over the last year.</p>

<p>This webinar series will run from July 10 through October 21. It’s a great opportunity to learn about effective practices from the vocational rehabilitation (VR) field and to explore innovations that are making a difference in VR program management.</p>

<p>The RTAC is a collaborative initiative to identify, test, and disseminate management practices to build a performance management model tailored to the VR system.
These webinars are free and open to the public. Register, and learn how state VR agencies are applying innovation to solve their toughest challenges!</p>
