The Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston is hosting a series of webinars on the use of labor market information (LMI) in Vocational Rehabilitation (VR). The webinars will present analyses linking occupational closure data from the Rehabilitation Services Administration’s Case Service Report (RSA-911) to LMI data.  

LMI provides a variety of workforce details associated with the successful employment of people with disabilities. This webinar series will explore the occupation types in which VR clients are most typically employed. The speakers will examine national and state level VR employment closure patterns by occupation, demographic distribution, and wage variation from 2008-2012 in this three-part series. This information will give the audience a sense of the labor market opportunities available to VR clients today, and highlight how understanding labor market trends may increase successful VR employment outcomes in the future.
