Variation in type of clients that an agency majorly serves affects the duration a client spends in vocational rehabilitation process. Following chart highlights the the national average time (in months) that clients spend in different type of agencies. 
We are presenting data for three type of agencies: 

- General: Agencies that serve clients with all kind of disabilities but not those with visual disabilities
- Blind: These agencies serve clients with visual disabilities
- Combined: These agencies serve all type of clients, i.e., with or without visual disabilities

Three metrics that are measured in the chart are:

- Average number of months spent from application to closure
- Average number of months spent from eligibility determination to closure
- Average number of months spent from IPE to closure
Data for different agency types is presented in the chart  for years from 2008 to 2011. By default, the chart displays the national average for 2008. User can select the preferred state from within the visualization and also navigate through different years by pressing on the arrow buttons in the visualization.
