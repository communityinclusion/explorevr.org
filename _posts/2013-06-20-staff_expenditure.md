This interactive visualization provides a comparative analysis of different state agencies in terms of their total expenditure and their staff strength. Agencies are divided into, 'general', 'blind' and 'combined' categories. States are broadly divided into two categories, where one type has combined agencies which cater to population with both general disabilities and also people with visual impairment. Other states have two different agencies to cater these two different segment of people with disabilities.
x-axis shows number of counsellors and y-axis shows amount of money expended in thousands.
