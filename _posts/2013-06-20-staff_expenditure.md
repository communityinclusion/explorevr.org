This interactive visualization provides a comparative analysis of state agencies in terms of their total expenditure and their number of staff. Agencies are divided into, 'general', 'blind' and 'combined' categories. 

*** The X-axis shows the number of counselors and the Y-axis shows the amount of money expended (in thousands).***
