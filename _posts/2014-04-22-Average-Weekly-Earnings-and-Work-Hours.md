**Description:** This chart displays the national average of weekly earnings and work hours for major occupation types at employment closure.

In general, weekly hours follow the trend of weekly earnings, i.e., less  earnings for less hours worked for any particular major occupation type.
Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media occupation breaks this trend, where weekly earnings are relatively higher for a relatively lower number of weekly hours. It should be noted that this occupation type corresponds to low volume occupations because a small number of VR clients are placed in 'Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media occupations'.

High volume occupations generally offer significantly lower weekly earnings for only a marginally lower number of hours worked during the week. For example in 2012, 'Food Preparation and Service Related Occupations' had average weekly earnings of $231.50 while VR clients worked for approximately 27 hours in that week. In comparison, clients employed in 'Architecture and Engineering Occupations' earned approximately $789.00 while they worked for approximately 37  hours in a week.

**Population:** All VR clients

**Data Source:** RSA-911

**Instructions:** Scroll over bars to see average weekly earnings at closure and on dots to find work hours. Click the dropdown menu to select data for years 2008-2012.
This chart has two x axes. The x axis at top displays the average number of hours worked at closure for a given occupation type and the x axis at the bottom refers to the average weekly earnings for a given occupation.
