**Description:** This chart presents the ratio of money spent on transition-age youth clients in comparison to all other clients. Numbers presented in this chart can also be understood as dollar value spent on transition age clients with closure in comparison dollar value spent on all the clients that a VR agency serves. By calculating ratio in this way, we are able to control for the total number of clients that are being served by an agency.

Ratio = Dollars spent on transition-age clients/ Dollars spent on all other clients

For example, the ratio for Delaware is 2.402, which means that if Delware VR service(s) is spending $100 on each of their clients (including transition age clients) on average, then on average they are spending $240 on each of their transition age clients.
