**Brief description:**

The goal of the Colorado Division of Vocational Rehabilitation project was to improve workforce planning.  During the development and implementation of the project the agency was faced with the loss of the agency director and by a time-consuming agency audit.  The agency was able to develop a workforce plan and tap into their peer network for support and guidance.

**Presenters:**  

Rob Buzogany, Manager Programs and Program Development  
Krista Dann, Deputy, Field Services
