## Average Spending on Rehabilitation Technology Services

**Description:** This figure presents the dollar amount that a VR agency spent on rehabilitation technology services from the years 2008-2013. The graph also shows the average of the total dollar amount that VR agencies spent per client in a given year.   

Rehabilitation technology services may include applying technological solutions to help individuals with disabilities overcome barriers. The amount that VR agencies spend on rehabilitation technology services in comparison to their overall spending may vary from year-to-year. The average in this case was calculated by dividing the total amount of money spent on providing given services by an agency and dividing it by the number of individuals who received such service. This figure presents the national (average) trends in spending on rehabilitation technology in comparison to the spending on all the services.

For example, in 2008 the VR system spent $1982.10 in total spending and $2638.43 in rehabilitation technology spending. In comparison, in 2013, the VR system spent $2114.07 and $3018.56 specifically on rehabilitation technology services.
