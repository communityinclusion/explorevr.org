### Brief description:

As part of California’s Vocational Rehabilitation Modernization efforts, the Vendor Utilization Management project was formally chartered in May 2013 to examine the Department of Rehabilitation’s business model, including the redesign and streamlining of its authorization, invoicing, payments, and disencumbering processes.  A sub-project to these efforts included a three month pilot that centralized the vendor invoice processing in the field.  This pilot was initiated in January 2014 to improve and streamline DOR invoice approval and payment processes and provide more timely payments to vendors.
