Answering the questions, “Who am I and what do I want to do with my life?” are abstract. Using materials adapted from Personal Preference Indicators* as well as other programs that focus on self concept helps shape students thinking about their feelings, social interests, social skills, daily living skills and making choices.  During the progress, students work with peers, teachers, and family to develop the self awareness necessary for them to become self-advocating individuals. The process discussed here integrates technology which enhances student engagement and exposes students to technology skills. This session will demonstrate the template of the students’ portfolios using hyperlinks, pictures, interviews, and short videos that help them tell their story and demonstrate their skills.  *(Center for Learning and Leadership, University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Centers)
