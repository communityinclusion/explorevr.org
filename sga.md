The Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) Project builds the capacity of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) organizations to improve employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. The SGA Project produces new knowledge through administrative data analysis of state VR agency employment outcomes for SSDI consumers, oversight by the Delphi Expert Panel, and case studies from high performing state VR agencies. VR agencies and partner organizations can benefit from the SGA Project through a rigorous examination of agency delivery mechanisms, trainings and manuals for implementing strategies, and on-demand technical assistance.
