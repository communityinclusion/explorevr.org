**A Systematic Research Synthesis on Vocational Rehabilitation Webinar**  
November 3, 2010  
Presenters: Heike Boeltzig, Martha Klemm, Allison Fleming, and Susan Foley  

Researchers present and discuss the findings of a systematic review of empirical research on the public VR system spanning 1970 to 2008. The review aimed to characterize the public VR program in terms of its programmatic and systematic features, the types of customers served, and the kinds of outcomes achieved as resported in research studies. More broadly, the review aimed to describe the existing VR research base, including gaps in research, and to make recommendations for future research investment. Researchers conducted an extensive literature search and then narrowed the sample to 550 studies that met the review criteria. A structured coding tool was used for data analysis and quality assessment. In addition to the findings, presenters discuss study implications as well as methodological challenges and how these were addressed.
