####Job-Driven Vocational Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Center 

The Job-Driven VRTAC strives to identify, adapt, embed, and sustain job-driven practices that lead to improved employment outcomes for people with disabilities. Our center supports businesses to find and retain productive workers. The center creates VR-specific sustainable models of job-driven practices. 

Outcomes and strategies from the Job-Driven VRTAC will develop a knowledge base on the four topic areas of labor market information, services to employers, building and maintaining employer relations, and services to training providers. 

The project activities focus on:

- Building state VR agenciesâ€™ capacity to improve and expand job-driven employment practices for consumers;
- Using and building upon promising and emerging job-driven strategies; 
- Providing three types of technical assistance (TA): intensive TA, targeted/specialized TA, and universal/general TA; and
- Disseminating materials pertaining to the use of job driven strategies.

The Job-Driven VRTAC is a collective partnership between the Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston and:

- Jobs for the Future (JFF)
- The University of Arkansas (UA) CURRENTS
- The University of Washington (UW)
- The US Business Leadership Network (USBLN)
- Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)
- Bobby Silverstein at Power, Pyles, Sutter & Verville

The Job-Driven VRTAC is funded by Rehabilitation Services Administration Grant #H264A140002.
