Demand-Side Strategies produces knowledge regarding state VR agencies’ capacity for assessing and meeting business needs.  Demand-Side engages three state agencies in unique on-site laboratories and conducts national surveys, case studies, and secondary data analysis to learn how state VR agencies can meet employer demands in changing economic environments. Outcomes and strategies from Demand-Side can be used to inform state agencies’ procedures and policies around improving business intelligence, serving the dual-customer, meeting industry demands, and utilizing labor market information as well as other factors.

**Project partners include:**

[Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services](http://www.rehab.alabama.gov/) will partner with ICI to examine potential impacts of integrating business intelligence efforts and labor market data across ADRS policies and procedures. Multiple research activities will occur to capture important features of strategic planning and data integration across agency practices.

[Nebraska Vocational Rehabilitation](http://www.vr.ne.gov/index.html) will work with the ICI to create a fast-track community college certificate program for VR consumers interested in pursuing a career in the healthcare industry. The program will be designed to meet specific community industry needs, based on information gathered from surveying employers. The study will emphasize a dual customer focus and ‘just-in-time’ training and internship programs.

[Vermont Division of Vocational Rehabilitation](http://vocrehab.vermont.gov/) will work with the ICI to implement a learning collaborative for rolling out the Progressive Employment (PE) Model in state VR agencies.  The study will document the implementation of this model at several learning collaborative sites and any potential impacts that the adoption of the model may have on employment outcomes.  The study will also capture VR consumer and employer experiences and perceptions of the PE model.
