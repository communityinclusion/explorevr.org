Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Vocational Rehabilitation (VR-RRTC) builds the capacity of public vocational rehabilitation (VR) programs to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. VR-RRTC functions as a national hub for VR policy data, research, and operations as well as for training and technical assistance. VR agencies, directors, researchers, and policy makers can contribute to VR-RRTCâ€™s data and research by participating in case studies, service provider surveys, and state agency surveys and can access resources to inform programmatic decisions and policy by reviewing research findings and utilizing ExploreVR.
