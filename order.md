##Webinars

####Maine Division of Vocational Rehabilitation - Eliminating and Maintaining No Waitlist: A Project Plan for Success! Webinar  
Wednesday, February 22, 2012 from 1:00-2:00 EST  
Wednesday, February 29, 2012 from 3:00-4:00 EST  
Presenters: Betsy Hopkins and Karen Fraser  

This webinar is the second in a series looking at promising practices in prioritizing and delivering of services to individuals with the most significant disabilities (MSD). Presenters will highlight results from case studies identifying strategies that VR agencies have used to manage outreach, service access, and case flow to ensure that individuals with MSD are served on a priority basis. Strategies include tools to manage priority categories, fiscal and human resources, performance, waitlists, and stakeholder communication. The goal of this webinar is to describe strategies the Maine Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) implemented in 2009 to eliminate the waitlist that had been in place since 2001. This practice represents a successful effort of moving out of Order of Selection (OOS) policy while still maintaining a focus on serving customers with the most significant disabilities.
