##ExploreVR Presents VR Employment Patterns Webinar Series

The Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston is hosting a series of webinars on the use of labor market information (LMI) in Vocational Rehabilitation (VR). The webinars will present analyses linking occupational closure data from the Rehabilitation Services Administration’s Case Service Report (RSA-911) to LMI data.  

LMI provides a variety of workforce details associated with the successful employment of people with disabilities. This webinar series will explore the occupation types in which VR clients are most typically employed. The speakers will examine national and state level VR employment closure patterns by occupation, demographic distribution, and wage variation from 2008-2012 in this three-part series. This information will give the audience a sense of the labor market opportunities available to VR clients today, and highlight how understanding labor market trends may increase successful VR employment outcomes in the future.

###LEARNING COLLABORATIVES
Explore VR hosts learning collaboratives, a peer-to-peer knowledge exchange model featuring face-to-face meetings, on-site and distance consultation, self-assessment, and tailored evaluation.  The current focus is on VR program management to initiate cross VR agency strategies for problem solving, identification and application of practice based solutions, and evaluation of related outcomes. [Contact us](/contact.html) to learn more about the Research and Technical Assistance Center (RTAC) on Vocational Rehabilitation Program Management learning collaborative. 

###COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE
Explore VR TA activities are based in part upon a community of practice approach. Individuals with a common interest in a problem or topic collaborate over time to define the topic, share ideas, and develop solutions or strategies. The working group defines a goal or outcome, and the duration of the working group depends on the complexity of the topic and the goal. Communities of practice disseminate research findings, define and expand the understanding of current strategy and policy, and inform local policy makers in participant networks.  The current focus is on how state VR agencies can meet employer needs in changing economic environments. [Contact us](/contact.html) to learn more about the Small Business Community of Practice.
