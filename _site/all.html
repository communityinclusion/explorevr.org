    <p> <p>Transition age (14-24) is an important age group for VR agencies. The following graphs present statistics on how different state vocational rehabilitation agencies are faring in terms of the number of transition age clients they are servicing in comparison to other clients (non-transition) and the amount of money they are spending on transition-age youth. </p>

      <a href="/experts/five-reasons.html">Five Reasons why VR Directors Need a Strong Peer Network</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>I heard recently that 18 new vocational rehabilitation (VR) directors have taken their positions within the past year. This means that more than one in five of the 80 VR directors across the country are new to their role.</p>

 </p>




    <h3>
      <a href="/policy/staff_expenditure.html">Agency Staff and Client Ratio</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>This interactive visualization provides a comparative analysis of state agencies in terms of their number staff and their number of clients. Agencies are divided into, ‘general’, ‘blind’ and ‘combined’ categories.</p>

 </p>




    <h3>
      <a href="/policy/state_oos.html">Agency Status - Order of Selection</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>Many states work under Order of Selection (OOS) to provide their services. The OOS provision is used for prioritizing and providing services to individuals with the most significant disabilities when the VR agency cannot serve all eligible individuals with disabilities under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>

 </p>




    <h3>
      <a href="/policy/state_expenditure.html">Agency Expenditures for FY 2007 - FY 2011</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>There is wide variation in the amount of money that state VR agencies expend. That expenditure is based on the number of people the agency is serving, staff, services provided, programs, etc. The following chart groups states by their expenditure. One can see the dollar value that each state expended in a given year between 2007-2011 by hovering over a particular agency. Each agency is represented by a block, which is sized proportionally to the money agency spent in a given year.</p>

 </p>




    <h3>
      <a href="/policy/medicaid-expansion.html">Affordable Care Act: Status of Medicaid Expansion</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is one of the most significant changes in the health care system of the United States. After the judgment of the Supreme Court, state governments are free to chose to either apply the ACA or not in their respective state. The map shows the current status of the state on whether they are accepting ACA or not. We will be updating this post as and when states change their stance.
To explore the map, please hover over the state to know its status—opposes, support or weighing options. Darker shades of the same color represent a higher population of people within that particular category.</p>

Nine dichotomized dummy variables were created.</p>
