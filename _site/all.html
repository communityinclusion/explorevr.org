      <a href="/policy/state_oos.html">Agency Status - Order of Selection</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>Many states work under Order of Selection (OOS) for providing their services. The OOS  provision is used for prioritizing and providing services to individuals with the most significant disabilities when the State VR agency cannot serve all eligible individuals with disabilities under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act. </p>

    <h3>
      <a href="/policy/state_expenditure.html">Agency Expenditures</a>
    </h3>
    <p> <p>There is wide variation in the amount of money that state VR agencies expend. That expenditure is based on the number of people the agency is serving, staff, services provided, programs, etc. The following chart groups states by their expenditure. One can see the dollar value that each state expended in a given year between 2007-2011 by hovering over a particular agency. Each agency is represented by a block sized proportionally to the money that they spend in any given year.</p>

    <p> <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is one of the most significan changes in the health care system of the United States. After the judgement of the Supreme Court, state governments are free to chose to either apply ACA or not in their respective states.
The map in this post shows the current status of the state on whether they are accepting ACA or not. We will be updating this post as and when states change their stance.
To explore the map, please hover over the state to know its status. Darker shades of same color represents higher population. </p>

    </h3>
    <p> <p>In the 2011 National Survey of State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies we asked VR agencies to report where they are located within the government structure of their state—their Designated State Agency (DSA) or “parent agency.” Based on survey responses to this question we categorized VR agencies into 1 of 5 categories: Labor / Workforce, Independent (they do not have a parent agency), Human/Social Services, Education, or Other. We paired this data with RSA-911 rehabilitation rate data to analyze rehabilitation rates based on parent agency. Rehabilitation rate is the ratio of successful closures (Status 26) relative to the sum of successful closures and people not rehabilitated with an IPE (Status 28). We created two charts, one for general and combined agencies and one for blind agencies. Rehabilitation rates for the following population groups are specifically included:</p>

    <p> <p>The rehabilitation rates for each type of disability at agency level were generated using RSA-911 FY2011 personal level data following these steps. Individuals were categorized into nine mutually exclusive disability groups (Visual, Hearing, Orthopedic, Intellectual, Substance abuse, Mental health, Learning disability, Traumatic brain injury and Other) based on the primary impairment and cause of primary impairment reported. Nine dichotomized dummy variables were created.</p>

The first two charts depict individual VR agencies' relinquished or requested funds for these two years and the third chart depicts the total funds relinquished or requested by parent agency type.
