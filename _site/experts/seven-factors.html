<h1>Public VR: The <em>Go-To</em> Organization for Transition-Age Youth with Disabilities</h1>



      <p>Robert Burns<br />
Senior Policy Fellow  </p>

<p><img src="/img/authors/Bob.jpg" alt="Robert Burns" class="pull-left" style="padding:.5em;" />Providing effective services to transition-age youth with disabilities has been, and will continue to be, a mainstay of the national public vocational rehabilitation program.  In my experience, there is no better organization positioned to serve this population.  By “positioned” I mean having the staff expertise, the community partnerships, the linkages with the business community, and the correct service delivery philosophy (individualized services based on the consumer’s strengths, interests, abilities, capabilities and informed choice.)</p>

<p>The Rehabilitation Act (Section 7(37)) and federal regulation §361.5(b)(55) which define “transition services“ speaks to these services as ”a coordinated set of activities for a student, designed within an outcome-oriented process that promotes movement from school to post-school activities including post-secondary education, vocational training, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation.”  <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a9eba8c9a9ec1a848229067e993d0f04&amp;node=34:2.1.1.1.7&amp;rgn=div5#34:2.1.1.1.7.1.135.5">§361.5(b)(55)</a></p>

<p>Nationally, transition-age youth represent almost 36% of all consumers served by state VR agencies (SVRAs) and 35% of SVRA successful employment outcomes.  By far, transition-age youth represent the largest consumer group served by VR.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the strengths, capacities and success demonstrated by the national VR program in serving this consumer population, we are being challenged to “do more, do it better, and to do it more efficiently.”  Without question, that is the message in the Rehabilitation Act which was passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed by President Obama. As responsible and responsive public organizations, SVRAs will undoubtedly welcome this challenge and embrace the opportunities it presents.</p>

<p>My experience as a VR transition counselor, district manager, administrator, and state director in VR, and my work nationally in recent years with ICI/UMass Boston has given me a “wide lens” on VR and services to transition-age youth.  My work in Maryland helped lead that SVRA to adopt the Maryland Seamless Transition Collaborative (2008-2012).  This systems change project worked to build statewide service delivery capacities and implemented a constellation of services that included the following components:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Student Engagement</strong> at least two years prior to graduation to assure a “connectedness” with and investment by the student in his/her career exploration/planning and experiences; building and sustaining an effective counseling relationship with the student; utilizing strength-based career planning.</li>
  <li><strong>Work-Based Experiences prior to graduation</strong> from high school including information interviews, industry tours, job shadowing, internships and paid employment.  A core concept of the program was to give all students an opportunity for a paid work experience prior to graduation.</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusive employment and/or post-secondary education</strong> – inclusive means community-based, integrated and, for employment, paid at the prevailing wage but no less than minimum wage.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensuring the student’s family is an active and positive partner</strong>; the parents need to understand and be included in the transition process and support the service strategies and goal(s).</li>
  <li><strong>Supporting the student’s social connectedness and overall health;</strong> research consistently demonstrates that an individual’s health (both somatic and psychological) can be negatively affected by not having social connections which can result feelings of loneliness and isolation; school-based activities, after-school clubs, religious and community service projects are examples of opportunities to connect the student socially.</li>
  <li><strong>Benefits planning and work incentives;</strong> an important example in this domain is SSA’s Student Earned Income Exclusion that permits the student to earning $1,750 per quarter and $7,060 per year without a reduction in SSI cash benefits.  http://www.socialsecurity.gov/redbook/</li>
  <li><strong>Systems Integration</strong> – An Executive Order was issued establishing the Governor’s Interagency Transition Council that brought together the key agencies (VR, Special Education, Developmental Disabilities, Mental Health, Workforce, Social Services, etc.) in order to build a collaborative and seamless service delivery. http://www.mdtransition.org/</li>
</ol>

<p>Part two of this discussion on transition services to youth with disabilities will be featured soon. In the second part, we will include thoughts from two state VR administrators who administer high-performing transition programs.  In addition, we will begin to synthesize elements that we find across effective programs serving transitioning youth with disabilities.</p>
