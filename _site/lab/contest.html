<h1>ExploreVR Open Data Competition</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of the ExploreVR Open Data Competition is to promote the utilization of data sets and analyses presented within the Data Lab. The Data Lab is an interactive web portal that offers access to a range of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) and related data. We release the data in its most raw form, as well as build useful applications to view the data. Because we take part in “open data” it is our hope that others will build off of and expand the work that we put forth.</p>
</div>
<h2>Competition Tracks</h2>

<p>Applicants can make submissions based on the usage of data from the ExploreVR Data Lab.</p>

<p>The competition is meant to encourage a wide range of possible data analyses on a VR-related topic of your choice. For example, a  focus of analysis could be:</p>

<ul class="well">
<li>National, state, or local levels</li>
<li>State VR agency type</li>
<li>Specific disability category</li>
<li>Specific population subgroup</li>
<li>Policy and regulations</li>
<li>Financial</li>
</ul>


<p>Produce an analysis and paper on of any of the data sets within the Data Lab by providing context for the data in the form of a brief (no longer than 4 pages).</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Each submission should be completed using the ‘Form for Submission’ and should contain the following information:</p>

<ul class="well">
<li>Name and contact information of author</li>
<li>Attachment of the paper and analysis</li>
<li>Brief Description of submission</li>
<li>Submitted works must be original and have the ability to be licensed under Creative Commons BY&amp;SA license.</li>
</ul>


<p>Only submissions submitted between April 1 and June 1, 2015 will be considered.</p>

<h2>Rating</h2>

<p>Data analyses and papers will be judged according to the following criteria:</p>

<ol type="a" class="well">
<li>Appropriateness of analysis</li>
<li>Novelty of approaches used in the analysis</li>
<li>Clarity of objectives, approaches, displays, and results</li>
<li>Significance of findings</li>
<li>Generalizability of approaches to data sets in other aspects of VR.</li>
<li>Overall quality of the analysis</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Datasets</h2>

<p>ExploreVR’s data sets and analyses are derived from RSA-911 data and can be found in the ExploreVR Data Lab at the following link: <a href="http://explorevr.org/lab/">http://explorevr.org/lab/</a>. The Data Lab houses the following three different types of data:</p>

<h4>RSA-911 Data</h4>

<p>The U.S. Department of Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) collects data on rehabilitation outcomes and services provided at the individual level for anyone who has applied for or received vocational rehabilitation services. The RSA-911 is an administrative dataset that captures a variety of demographic and other data for each individual whose case is closed during the fiscal year. It includes data such as: type of disability, services provided through the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) and Supported Employment (SE) Programs, providers and costs of services, and employment outcomes.</p>

<h4>VR Survey Data</h4>

<p>The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) has surveyed a number of vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies statewide to measure levels of VR services provided with respect to employment outcomes, agency partnerships, state demographics and other data points.</p>

<h4>Data Analyses</h4>

<p>The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) has generated a number of data analyses to increase knowledge about the public VR program and its role within the larger employment and disability service system within and across states and territories.</p>

<h2>Awards</h2>

<p>The winner(s) of the competition will be the featured user. Featured users refer to individuals using data on the site to advance knowledge, change policies, or modify practices. Featured users will be highlighted on the front page of Explore VR with a short description of how they used ExploreVR and the impact of use.</p>

<p>We will identify a winner who used data from ExploreVR for analysis and paper and present them with an award of $350.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>This contest has been designed to demonstrate the benefit of open access of data. Please participate in and engage with the contest in that spirit and in good faith. You must not include submissions that are:</p>
