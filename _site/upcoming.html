<h3 id="learning-collaboratives">LEARNING COLLABORATIVES</h3>
<p>Explore VR hosts learning collaboratives, a peer-to-peer knowledge exchange model featuring face-to-face meetings, on-site and distance consultation, self-assessment, and tailored evaluation.  The current focus is on VR program management to initiate cross VR agency strategies for problem solving, identification and application of practice based solutions, and evaluation of related outcomes. <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> to learn more about the Research and Technical Assistance Center (RTAC) on Vocational Rehabilitation Program Management learning collaborative. </p>

<h3 id="communities-of-practice">COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE</h3>
<p>Explore VR TA activities are based in part upon a community of practice approach. Individuals with a common interest in a problem or topic collaborate over time to define the topic, share ideas, and develop solutions or strategies. The working group defines a goal or outcome, and the duration of the working group depends on the complexity of the topic and the goal. Communities of practice disseminate research findings, define and expand the understanding of current strategy and policy, and inform local policy makers in participant networks.  The current focus is on how state VR agencies can meet employer needs in changing economic environments. <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> to learn more about the Small Business Community of Practice.</p>
